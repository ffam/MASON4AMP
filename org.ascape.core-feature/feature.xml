      Ascape Core API, without UI target. Ascape is an innovative tool for developing and exploring general-purpose agent-based models. Ascape offers a broad array of modeling and visualization tools. A high-level framework supports complex model design, while end-user tools make it possible for non-programmers to explore many aspects of model dynamics.
