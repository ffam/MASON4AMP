In this section of the guide, we'll discuss specific aspects of the Agent Modeling tools and show you how to use them in your day to day agent development activities. We discuss only tools specific to Agent Modeling itself. For more general information about the tools, such as how to customize editors, views, and perspectives, see the '''Workbench User Guide'''.

==Overview==

The Agent Modeling Platform provides two general modes or "perspectives" for working with Agent Models.

'''Agent Modeling''' supports all aspects of working with models, including editing models and automatically generating all the of your code and documentation. '''Agent Execution''' supports running and exploring those models. A key feature of the Agent Modeling Platform is the ability to execute models within the same environment that they are developed within -- you don't need to launch a separate environment in order to run a model. Agent Execution automatically activates when you launch a model. We'll discuss the agent modeling tools first, and then turn to agent execution.
