<p>If you find this tool valuable, please be aware that most of its development occurred through volunteer contributions from individuals and companies that have received no direct funding. You can support continual development efforts financially by purchasing related software tools from companies and organizations that help develop it, including funding for developer time in grant proposals. You can support the Eclipse platform in general by becoming a member organization of Eclipse. But the most important thing that you can contribute is your own time and enthusiasm, either through directly contributing to AMP or by promoting its use in blogs and other social media. For more detailed information about contributing to AMP, the following sections.</p>
