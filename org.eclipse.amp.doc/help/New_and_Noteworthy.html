<td>
							<span class="bold"><strong>Graph Visualization</strong></span>

						<td>Built in support for visualization and generation (as always with AMF, no code to write!) of graph models.</td>

<td>
							<span class="bold"><strong>3D View Improvements</strong></span>
						</td>
						<td>2 1/2 visualizations now support interpolated positions for agents. You can't see that here, but it means that the agents move smoothly through space, even if they are on a fixed grid. You can turn that feature on and off and you can change perspective easily.</td>

</td>
					
</tr>
<tr>
						
<td>
							<span class="bold"><strong>API Improvements</strong></span>
						</td>
						<td>There have been significant changes to the APIs. As always, we've followed common Eclipse and EMF idioms, which means that to customize model visualization you typically only need to implement figure, shape or color providers and then adapt them to your model. And of course all of your existing models will generate code for the new APIs.</td>
					
</tr>
<tr>
						
<td>
							<span class="bold"><strong>More Legacy Views</strong></span>
						</td>
						<td>In addition, we've supported all existing Ascape views (not all of these are supported through AMF generated code..yet!).</td>

<table id="N1153E">
<tr>
						
<td>
							<span class="bold"><strong>New Actions</strong></span>
						</td>
						<td>Some key new Actions have just been introduced. These provide support for recursion (Cause and Perform), minimization and maximization queries, diffusion (Diffuse) and derived (Derive) values and give the framework a much more general purpose flavor while preserving model generality. You should be able to build many more kinds of models without resorting to custom coding. See the Modeler's guide Actions section for the details.</td>
					
</tr>
<tr>
						
<td>
							<span class="bold"><strong>Improved Model Representation and Generation</strong></span>
						</td>
						<td>There have been many improvements to how models can be designed and the code that is generated from those designs. As just one example, you can now search for agents within a model without having to specify an explicit space. As with model editing improvements, many of these changes have been driven by user input. If there is something you'd like to be able to do with AMF but can't, let us know by filing a feature request or posting to the newsgroup.</td>
					
</tr>
<tr>
						
<td>
							<span class="bold"><strong>Multiscale Support</strong></span>
						</td>
						<td>Support for modeling across scales has been greatly improved. For the Escape target it is very easy to define models with enclosing hierarchies. For example in the EpidemicRegion model, we've defined Regions which contain Cities which contain Individuals.</td>

<td>
							<span class="bold"><strong>Overall Usability</strong></span>
						</td>
						<td>Significant effort has gone into improving the overall user interface for editing models. User feedback has been enormously helpful here -- please keep letting us know what works and what doesn't! In addition to the obvious changes, a lot of work has been done under the covers to provide a more seamless model building experience. We've fixed some glitches, but we've also added a number of things to help simplify and automate the model building process. As an example, when you create an agent, a style is automatically created along with default color, shape and paint actions.</td>
					
</tr>
<tr>
						
<td>
							<span class="bold"><strong>New Icons</strong></span>
						</td>
						<td>Most of the existing icons have been replaced or custom designed (which has incidentally required a lot of documentation to be recreated) to provide a better and more consistent user interface.</td>
					
</tr>
<tr>
						
<td>
							<span class="bold"><strong>Action Lists</strong></span>
						</td>
						<td>Actions are now displayed in lists, not in a tree structure. As the actual Actions are graph structures, the tree structure never matched well with this representation. Taking a simpler approach has made the action definition process much more transparent.</td>
